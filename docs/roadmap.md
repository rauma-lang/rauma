- v0.0.8v self-build CLI tool target ✓ DONE
- v0.0.8w rmc bridge consolidation ✓ DONE
- v0.0.8x self-build readiness audit ✓ DONE
- v0.0.8y rmc-mini standalone target ✓ DONE
- v0.0.8z v0.0.8 stabilization ✓ DONE
- Complete the `rmc` bridge milestone: `rmb` builds `rmc`, and `rmc` builds
  supported single-file targets including tiny/tool/rmc-mini.
- Defer real self-host fixed point, multi-file `rmc build`, HIR/MIR, and full
  backend work to v0.0.9 and later.

### v0.0.9 Self-host Fixed Point
- v0.0.9a standalone rmc-mini hardening ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9b rmc multi-file build foundation ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9c real rmc module group build ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9d larger rmc CLI module group build ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9e real-ish rmc frontend module group build ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9f rmc compiler candidate ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9g fixed-point candidate ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9g-fix controlled candidate chain ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9g-fix reached `rmc0 -> rmc1 -> rmc2 -> rmc3` for the controlled
  `rmb/tests/rmc_candidate/` source only.
- v0.0.9h real-rmc self-host expansion ✓ PARTIAL
- v0.0.9h-fix2 boolean/logical bridge lowering ✓ PARTIAL
- v0.0.9h-fix2 lowers comparisons, `&&`, `||`, and parenthesized boolean
  expressions in `rmc/cgen/cgen.rm`; the focused
  `rmb/tests/rmc_bool_bridge/main.rm` fixture builds and prints the expected
  five-line output.
- v0.0.9h-fix3 real-rmc blocker sprint ✓ PARTIAL
- v0.0.9h-fix3 fixes five focused bridge blockers: top-level `use` parsing,
  qualified call parsing, parenthesized/unary/additive comparison parsing,
  `str` return cgen, `bool` parameter cgen, and string builtin/local emission
  support.
- Real self-host remains Tier 0: `rmb` still builds `rmc0`, but
  `rmc0 build ../rmc/main.rm` now reaches generated C compilation and reports
  `build failed: cc failed`; direct `rmc0 parse/check ../rmc/main.rm` now pass.
- v0.0.9h-fix4 generated-C graph sprint ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9h-fix4 fixes generated-C prototypes, scoped compatibility macros,
  nested bridge dependency emission, unused static helper handling, and
  string-aware local/print lowering.
- Real self-host now reaches Tier 4: `rmc0`, `rmc1-real`, and `rmc2-real`
  each build `../rmc/main.rm`; `rmc3-real version/help` pass.
- Candidate chain, bool fixture, previous frontend/probe/mini regressions, old
  rmc smokes, project smokes, and `make test` still pass.
- v0.0.9i deterministic real self-host verification ✓ DONE
- v0.0.9i proves the bridge self-host chain is deterministic for generated C:
  `real_from_rmc0.c`, `real_from_rmc1.c`, and `real_from_rmc2.c` match exactly
  with SHA-256
  `34e3bfe394347d852aa34db5dc753f6f22e63ed1a119d6d54d57b079da93db27`
  and size `207067`.
- `rmc1-real`, `rmc2-real`, and `rmc3-real` behavior matches for version,
  help, demo lex/parse, file lex/parse/check, emit-c, candidate build/self-test,
  `wat`, and no-args.
- Do not claim real compiler self-hosting until the staged build applies to the
  real `rmc` source and comparison strategy.
- Next option: v0.1.0 stabilization/release hardening while keeping the bridge
  architecture limitations explicit.

### v0.1.0 Usable Compiler
- Stable self-hosting compiler ✓ DONE
- Deterministic generated C comparison ✓ DONE
- Behavior comparison across real self-host stages ✓ DONE
- GitHub Actions CI and release automation ✓ DONE
- Release packages include `rauma-rmc`, `rauma-rmb`, `rauma-setup`, and
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` ✓ DONE
- Documentation, install notes, and release process ✓ DONE
- Still limited to bridge C backend and local module graph; package manager,
  stdlib lookup, HIR/MIR, LLVM, rmgen, and rmlink remain future work.

## Future Considerations

### Post v1.0
- Standard library expansion
- Additional backend targets (LLVM)
- Package management system
- Language server protocol (LSP)
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced type system features
- Concurrency primitives

## Versioning Policy

- **v0.0.x** - Development phase, breaking changes expected
- **v0.1.0** - First stable release
- **Semantic Versioning** post v1.0

## Stability Goals

- `rmb` (bootstrap compiler) remains stable C11 codebase
- `rmc` (main compiler) evolves with language
- Backward compatibility prioritized post v1.0
- Clear migration paths for breaking changes
